Another star crossed the sky,
twirling and twisting over itself,
as if it were reveling in its own sparkling beauty.
It was chased by another,
and another,
until a brigade of them were unleashed from the edge of the horizon,
like a thousand archers had loosed them from mighty bows.
The stars cascaded over us,
filling the world with white and blue light. 
They were like living fireworks, 
and my breath lodged in my throat as the stars kept on falling and falling. 
I’d never seen anything so beautiful.
“There must be hundreds of them,” I managed to say, 
dragging my stare back to the stars whizzing past.
“Thousands,” he said. “They’ll keep coming until dawn. Or, I hope they will. 
There were less and less of them the last time I witnessed Starfall.”
“What’s happening to them?”
“I wish I knew. But they keep coming back despite it.”
“Why?”
“Why does anything cling to something? 
Maybe they love wherever they’re going so much that it’s worth it.
Maybe they’ll keep coming back, until there’s only one star left. 
Maybe that one star will make the trip forever, out of the hope that someday––
if it keeps coming back often enough––
another star will find it.”
